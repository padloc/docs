## What is a password manager and why should I use one?

We'll let our friends at the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org)
take this one:

## What's so special about Padloc?

We believe that software should not only be useful but also simple and fun to
use. Padloc is all about simplicity and usability. We deliberately left out
features that make other password managers unnecessarily complex and potentially
confusing. Padloc focuses only on the most essential functionality. **No
clutter, no distractions**. We also put a high value on transparency and
actively encourage inspection and contributions by other developers.

## Why should I trust you?

**You don't have to!** Padloc is completely open source and we actively
encourage developers to inspect the source code and offer contributions. This
not only makes it impossible for us to build in back doors but also helps to
identify and eliminate possible security flaws quickly and efficiently.

## Do I have to pay to use Padloc?

**No.** Padloc has a **Free** plan that allows you to store an unlimited number of items!

## Where is my data stored?

Your data is stored in a data center located in Frankfurt, Germany (provided by
[DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)).

## Wasn't this called "Padlock" before?

It used to be "Padlock" but along with the release of version 3.0 we decided to
do a minor rebranding, dropping the "k" from the name to make it a little less
generic, more memorable and frankly easier to recognize by search engines.
