## The Problem

Have you ever experienced something like this? ðŸ‘‡

<blockquote>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Hi Reddit, I'd like to see some pictures of cute kittens please!</span>  
    <br>
    <span class="red highlighted"><strong>Reddit</strong>: Your session has expired. Please log in again!</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Sure thing! Wait, what's my password again? It had my pets name I think? And probably my birthday? A I think I got it.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="red highlighted"><strong>Reddit</strong>: Incorrect username or password. Please try again!</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Hm. Ok maybe it was my mothers birthday?</span>
    <br>
    <span class="red highlighted"><strong>Reddit</strong>: Incorrect username or password. Please
try again!</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Damnit. Ah, I think I added a '$' at the end. Or was it a '*'? I remember something about a special character being required...</span>
    <br>
    <span class="red highlighted"><strong>Reddit</strong>: Incorrect username or password. Please try
again!</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Ok, I give up. Reddit, I feel terrible for asking but can you please send me a new password?</span>
    <br>
    <span class="red highlighted"><strong>Reddit</strong>: Sure thing. Please enter your email address.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: I can do that! Here you go.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="red highlighted"><strong>Reddit</strong>: No user found with this email address.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Gahhh. Maybe I used my Hotmail address? But I haven't used
that one in ages. Oh well, it's worth a shot...</span>
    <br>
    <span class="red highlighted"><strong>Reddit</strong>: An email has been sent to <strong>iheartkittens@hotmail.com</strong>. Please follow the instructions enclosed in the email.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Thank god... Ok lets check my Hotmail account. </span>
    <br>
    <span class="purple highlighted"><strong>Hotmail</strong>: Hi there! Please enter your username and password.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="blue highlighted"><strong>Me</strong>: Sure thing! Wait... </span>

We've all been there. There is just so many accounts, passwords and other
information to keep track of it seems impossible to not get confused and
overwhelmed. And to make things worse, every website and app has their own
arbitrary rules for passwords and usernames that not only make each signup an
annoying chore but end up making each password even harder to remember. This
problem has existed for ages, but the situation seems to get worse by the
minute, as every day countless new apps and websites emerge that all want not
only part of your attention, but some of your personal data as well. **Properly
protecting your digital presence has become more important than ever** and we've
long since gotten to the point where trying to keep all your passwords and other
sensitive information in your head seems not only impractical but downright
irresponsible.

## There's an app for that.

Of course, there is an app for that. Quite few in fact. Password managers exist
in all shapes and colors, and have become an important part of many peoples
digital lives. You've never heard of password managers, or are you not quite
clear on how they work? The amazing people at the
[Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-using-password-managers-stay-safe-online)
explain it much better than we ever could:

## Enter Padloc

As we've mentioned before, there are quite a few password managers out there and
many of them are quite good! So why should you choose Padloc over other password
managers? Well, there are lots of reasons, but instead of listing a bunch of dry
arguments we'd rather just show you! So why don't you go ahead and just [give it
a try]({% relref "../create_account" %})?
