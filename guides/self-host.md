With the release of Padloc 4 it's even easier to self-host your own server and
apps, so you don't even have to trust us!

You can see
[some up-to-date guides using Docker here](https://github.com/padloc/padloc/tree/main/docs/examples/hosting/docker).

And if you want to build your own apps, you can see [some up-to-date guides on how to do that here](https://github.com/padloc/padloc/tree/main/docs/examples/hosting/app).
